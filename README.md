# mls-bot
A simple discord bot draft that will be changed and applied to the MLS server in the future. 

*Won Technica: Best Beginner Hack Award*

*** Inspiration ***

After attending the "API Fundamentals" webinar at Technica, I learned the many applications of APIs in code as well as the fact that it is applied to discord bots. I run a server called "Hunter College MLS" and wanted to build a discord bot that will serve all functions that users desire instead of constantly inviting public discord bots into the server for different functions.

*** What it does ***
The bot is capable of saying hello, creating study sessions, and retrieving jokes from a public API domain.

*** How it was built ***
Using Python, I followed a tutorial on how to get started with creating a Discord bot. Following this, I understood how to make a command prompt for the bot and created a "joke" command prompt where the bot will retrieve a joke from the public API domain provided during the "API Fundamentals" webinar and paste the joke into the channel server. NOTE: The code that creates the study sessions is not my line of code, as I was following a tutorial.

*** Challenges faced ***
Unable to fix the time presented when study sessions start and end to showcase the correct time zone (EST) as well as making it easy to read

*** Lessons Learned ***
How to apply a public API into a line of code, particularly for a discord bot
How to set up a virtual environment to create a discord bot

*** What's next for MLS Discord Bot ***
I would like to change how the time is showcased by the bot to be user-friendly. Additionally, I would like to add a public API that will retrieve questions from the NYS Clinical Laboratory Technologist Exam to aid fellow students with their studying for licensure. Finally, I would like to figure out how to host the discord bot 24/7 as it can only run through my line of code at the moment.
